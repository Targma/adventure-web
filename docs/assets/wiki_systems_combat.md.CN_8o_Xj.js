Combat flows naturally in real-time, but player retain absolute control through comprehensive pause mechanics, allowing for tactical analysis and precise order coordination at any moment.</p><h2

Command&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Real-Time Flow</strong> : Combat progresses continuously, creating dynamic and fluid battlefield conditions where timing and positioning matter as much as raw power.</p><p><strong>Strategic Pause</strong> : Player can halt time instantly to reassess battlefield conditions, issue new orders, and adjust tactical approaches without pressure.</p><p><strong>Variable Time Scale</strong> : Control the pace of engagement to match your preferred command style, from methodical tactical planning to intense real-time action.</p><h3 id="victory-determinants" tabindex="-1">Victory Determinants <a class="header-anchor" href="#victory-determinants" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Victory Determinants&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Combat outcomes are influenced by multiple interconnected factors:</p><p><strong>Unit Composition &amp; Numbers</strong> : The foundation of tactical superiority lies in deploying the right combination of specialists in optimal quantities for each engagement type.</p><p><strong>Equipment Mastery</strong> : Gear quality, weapon proficiency, and armor effectiveness create significant power differentials that can overcome numerical disadvantages.</p><p><strong>Ability Utilization</strong> : Strategic deployment of runic abilities, special techniques, and timing-sensitive maneuvers often determines the outcome of closely matched encounters.</p><p><strong>Consumable Resources</strong> : Potions, elixirs, and tactical items provide crucial battlefield advantages that can shift momentum at critical moments.</p><h2 id="advanced-tactical-systems" tabindex="-1">Advanced Tactical Systems <a class="header-anchor" href="#advanced-tactical-systems" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Advanced Tactical

Authority&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Global Mana Abilities</strong> : Player wields powerful mana abilities that can directly alter battlefield conditions, from environmental manipulation to direct damage dealing.</p><p><strong>Strategic Resource Management</strong> : Mana represents a finite but renewable resource that must be carefully allocated across multiple tactical options during prolonged engagements.</p><h3 id="target-prioritization" tabindex="-1">Target Prioritization <a class="header-anchor" href="#target-prioritization" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Target Prioritization&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Effective combat requires understanding enemy vulnerabilities and adapting targeting strategies accordingly:</p><p><strong>Spellcaster Vulnerability</strong> : Casting units suffer maximum disruption from attack progress knockback, making them priority targets for interrupt-focused strategies.</p><p><strong>Ranged Unit Disruption</strong> : Archers and similar ranged combatants experience moderate knockback effects, allowing for effective harassment tactics.</p><p><strong>Melee Resistance</strong> : Close-combat specialists remain immune to attack progress knockback, requiring alternative tactical approaches such as crowd control or overwhelming force.</p><h3 id="environmental-warfare" tabindex="-1">Environmental Warfare <a class="header-anchor" href="#environmental-warfare" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Environmental Warfare&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Terrain Utilization</strong> : Natural and constructed chokepoints become force multipliers when facing numerically superior opponents.</p><p><strong>Mana-Enhanced Terrain</strong> : Environmental abilities can create temporary barriers, difficult terrain, or tactical advantages that reshape the battlefield to favor strategic positioning.</p><p><strong>Crowd Control Mastery</strong> : Effective use of immobilization, slowing effects, and area denial ensures that superior numbers cannot be brought to bear simultaneously.</p><h2 id="tactical-principles" tabindex="-1">Tactical Principles <a class="header-anchor" href="#tactical-principles"

aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Engagement Doctrine&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Threat Assessment</strong> : Identify and neutralize the most dangerous opponents first, typically spellcasters and specialized damage dealers.</p><p><strong>Crowd Control Priority</strong> : Disable key threats through strategic application of stuns, immobilization, and other status effects rather than attempting to eliminate all enemies simultaneously.</p><p><strong>Resource Conservation</strong> : Balance immediate tactical needs with long-term sustainability, ensuring that consumables and mana are available for critical moments.</p><p><strong>Positioning Superiority</strong> : Leverage terrain, chokepoints, and formation advantages to negate enemy numerical superiority.</p><h3 id="combat-flow-management" tabindex="-1">Combat Flow Management <a class="header-anchor" href="#combat-flow-management" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Combat Flow Management&quot;">​</a></h3><p><strong>Initiative

tactical approaches based on emerging battlefield conditions and enemy responses.</p><p><strong>Escalation Management</strong> : Gradually deploy more powerful abilities and resources as engagement intensity increases, reserving ultimate techniques for decisive moments.</p><h2 id="combat-status-effects" tabindex="-1">Combat Status Effects <a class="header-anchor" href="#combat-status-effects"

Entities can still attack and use abilities but cannot change position.</p><p><strong>Sleep</strong> - Renders the target unconscious and unable to act. Similar to stun but may have different resistance mechanics and can be broken by damage.</p><p><strong>Fear</strong> - Causes the target to lose control and flee. The entity becomes uncontrollable and may attempt to move away from threats.</p><p><strong>Frozen</strong> - Completely disables actions and movement until first damage taken, which is increased.</p><h3 id="damage-effects" tabindex="-1">Damage Effects <a class="header-anchor" href="#damage-effects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Damage Effects&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Effects that deal damage over time:</p><p><strong>Poison</strong> - Inflicts nature damage over time with high penetration while lowering healing received.</p><h3 id="stat-modification-effects" tabindex="-1">Stat Modification Effects <a class="header-anchor" href="#stat-modification-effects" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Stat Modification Effects&quot;">​</a></h3><p>Effects that enhance or reduce entity capabilities:</p><p><strong>Offensive Break</strong> - Significantly reduces damage output, making attacks much less effective.</p><p><strong>Defensive Break</strong> - Reduces damage resistance, making the target more vulnerable to incoming attacks.</p><p><strong>Offensive Enchantment</strong> - Increases damage output and offensive capabilities.</p><p><strong>Defensive Enchantment</strong> - Improves damage resistance and defensive stats.</p><p><strong>Sprint</strong> - Increases movement speed and dodge rate for improved mobility.</p><p><strong>Slow</strong> - Reduces movement speed.</p><h3 id="effect-mechanics" tabindex="-1">Effect Mechanics <a class="header-anchor" href="#effect-mechanics" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Effect Mechanics&quot;">​</a></h3><h4 id="duration" tabindex="-1">Duration <a class="header-anchor" href="#duration" aria-label="Permalink to &quot;Duration&quot;">​</a></h4><p>Most effects have a set duration that counts down over time.
