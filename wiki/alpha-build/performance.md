# Performance Optimization

*Demonstrating the engine's capability to handle complex, large-scale simulations*

## Overview

RuneEra's engine has been extensively optimized from the ground up to handle the demanding requirements of simulating multiple 
world areas simultaneously. Our performance architecture ensures smooth gameplay even during the most resource-intensive scenarios.

## Performance Metrics
During development we primarily focused on following metrics

### Frame Rate Stability
- **Target**: 60 FPS minimum during standard gameplay
- **Stress Test**: 30+ FPS during maximum load scenarios
- **Consistency**: Minimal frame time variance across different activities

### Memory Management
- **Baseline Usage**: Large usage of memory due to large texture sizes
- **Scaling**: Small and linear memory growth with additional explored areas

### Timings
- **Startup**: Initializes all static type definitions objects takes around 2s
- **Load**: Load from game menu longer due to UI initialization. Total time around 6s
- **Save**: Heavily depends on the number of areas, on average < 100ms per area, 10 areas 1 second
- **Area Transitions**: Instantaneous switching between explored areas

## Performance Demonstrations

### Multiple Settlement Operations
Complex multi-area management showcasing the engine's ability to handle:
- Simultaneous faction activities across different biomes
- Inter-settlement trade and resource flow
- Coordinated military operations
- Population management at scale

**Key Metrics:**
- Stable frame rates with 5+ active settlements
- Minimal memory overhead during area switching
- Smooth transition between distant locations
- Real-time synchronization of faction activities

### Large-Scale Resource Gathering
Intensive resource extraction scenarios demonstrating:
- Mass caravan operations across multiple areas
- Coordinated mining and harvesting activities
- Complex supply chain management
- Environmental impact simulation

**Performance Highlights:**
- Hundreds of simultaneous gathering operations
- Dynamic resource node depletion calculations
- Real-time inventory management across distances
- Efficient pathfinding for large groups

### Large-Scale Battle Scenarios
Combat stress testing featuring:
- Massive faction warfare with hundreds of units
- Complex battlefield AI coordination
- Real-time damage and status effect calculations
- Dynamic terrain modification during combat

**Battle System Efficiency:**
- Smooth performance with 200+ active combat units
- Accurate collision detection and pathfinding
- Dynamic visual effects without frame drops
- Efficient AI decision-making algorithms
