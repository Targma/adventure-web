## Current Build Status

The RuneEra alpha build is designed to showcase the core technical achievements and gameplay mechanics to our community and potential backers. While fully playable from start to finish, please be aware of the following limitations:

## Known Limitations

**üé® Placeholder Assets**
- All visual assets are AI-generated placeholders due to current budget constraints
- Professional artwork will replace these assets in the final release following our Kickstarter campaign

**‚öôÔ∏è Technical Considerations**
- **Potential Deadlocks**: The game is heavily multithreaded for performance optimization. Rare possibility of permanent game freezing due to threading issues
- **Vulkan Renderer**: Built with Godot 4.4.1 using Vulkan renderer - requires modern GPU hardware

## System Requirements
- **Graphics**: Modern GPU with Vulkan support
- **OS**: Windows 10/11, (Linux support is currently not available, should be possible at a later date)
