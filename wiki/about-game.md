**Core Gameplay & Inspiration**

RuneEra draws inspiration from the acclaimed [RimWorld](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RimWorld), 
renowned for its emergent storytelling and dynamic gameplay systems.
While maintaining the engaging colony management foundation, we've enhanced the experience with
deep RPG mechanics inspired by beloved titles such as ArcheAge, Valheim, and Path of Exile.

**Progression System**

The game features a structured tier-based progression system spanning five distinct tiers (I-V). 
Each tier presents unique challenges and opportunities:

- **Resource Gathering**: Collect biome-specific materials essential for advancement
- **Equipment Crafting**: Create increasingly powerful gear suited to your playstyle
- **Technology Research**: Unlock new capabilities and expand your strategic options
- **Boss Encounters**: Face formidable challenges that test your preparation and tactics

**Settlement Development**

Your journey begins with a single settlement and three guild members. As you progress, you can choose to expand 
through multiple approaches:

- **Settlements**: Establish additional settlements across different biomes
- **Outposts**: Create outposts linked by portals for fast transportation
- **Caravans**: Use caravans to gather and transport resources

**Dynamic World**

The world of RuneEra is alive with competing interests and constant challenges. Other factions pursue their own agendas, creating opportunities for trade, alliance, or conflict. 
Meanwhile, relentless undead armies pose an ever-present threat, ensuring that no settlement is ever truly safe.

This creates a rich, evolving gameplay experience where every decision matters and no two playthroughs are identical.
