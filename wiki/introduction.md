**Welcome to the RuneEra Wiki**

This comprehensive wiki showcases RuneEra, an ambitious RPG colony management game currently in development. Our primary goal is to share our vision with the gaming 
community and invite you to join us in bringing this project to life through our upcoming Kickstarter campaign.

**About the Development Journey**

RuneEra is a passion project born from years of programming experience and a deep love for colony management and RPG games. As a solo developer, 
my expertise lies in creating robust game systems, mechanics, and technical architecture. However, realizing the full artistic vision of RuneEra requires collaboration with talented artists who can bring the game world to life.

**Current Visual Assets**

The artwork displayed throughout this wiki serves as conceptual visualization to demonstrate the game's potential. These placeholder assets,
created using AI tools, help illustrate gameplay concepts and the overall aesthetic direction. With your support through our Kickstarter campaign, we plan to 
commission professional artists to create the hand-crafted artwork that RuneEra deserves.

**How You Can Help**

By exploring this wiki and learning about RuneEra's features, systems, and vision, you're taking the first step in potentially becoming part of our 
development journey. Your support through our upcoming Kickstarter campaign will directly fund professional artwork and help us deliver a polished, 
visually stunning game that matches the depth of its gameplay systems.

Thank you for your interest in RuneEra. We're excited to share this adventure with you.
