# Disease System

**Complex Biological Threats and Recovery**

Diseases in RuneEra represent persistent, evolving threats that create long-term strategic challenges for
settlement management. Unlike simple debuffs, diseases feature progressive severity, contagion mechanics,
and complex recovery systems that affect humanoids, animals, and even plant life.

## Disease Characteristics

**Multi-Layered Threat System**

### Progressive Penalty System
- **Escalating Effects**: Disease penalties increase in severity over time if left untreated
- **Compound Consequences**: Multiple diseases can stack, creating devastating combined effects
- **Time-Sensitive**: Early intervention is crucial for preventing severe complications

### Transmission Varieties
- **Fatal Diseases**: Can result in permanent death if not properly managed
- **Contagious Diseases**: Spread between individuals through proximity and contact

## Disease Sources and Transmission

**Multiple Infection Vectors**

### Environmental Sources

- **Biome Events**: Environmental disease outbreaks that immediately infect exposed individuals. Jungle biomes have significantly higher disease occurrence rates
- **Social Transmission**: Diseases spread through close proximity between humanoids
- **Diseased Animals**: Infected wildlife that spread diseases through combat
- **Environmental Hazards**: Toxic weather

## Three-Stage Disease Progression

**Complex Recovery Mechanics**

### Stage 1: Infection

**Initial Exposure and Transmission**
- **Proximity Transmission**: Infection increases when humanoids are within close range of infected individuals
- **Rapid Spread**: Infection levels can rise quickly in crowded areas
- **Natural Decay**: Infection levels decrease when separated from infected sources

### Stage 2: Disease Progression

**Active Disease Development**
- **Time-Based Progression**: Disease severity increases automatically over time depending on a stat modifier
- **Escalating Effects**: Negative effects become more severe as disease progresses

### Stage 3: Immunity Development

**Recovery and Protection**

**Immunity Acquisition**
- **Treatment Acceleration**: Medical treatment significantly increases immunity development
- **Rest Benefits**: Resting in medical facilities enhances immunity gain
- **Natural Recovery**: Slow immunity development occurs even without treatment

**Immunity Mechanics**
- **Disease Suppression**: When immunity is achieved, disease progression slowly reverses toward 0%
- **Temporary Protection**: Upon reaching zero disease progression, immunity begins to fade
- **Reinfection Protection**: Active immunity prevents reinfection from the same disease
- **Gradual Decline**: Immunity decreases over time, eventually allowing reinfection

## Strategic Disease Management

**Settlement Health Infrastructure**

### Prevention Strategies

**Environmental Controls**
- **Quarantine Protocols**: Isolation of infected individuals prevents spread
- **Medical Facilities**: Dedicated medical rooms enhance treatment effectiveness and prevent spread

### Treatment Approaches

**Medical Infrastructure**
- **Trained Medics**: Skilled medical personnel improves treatment quality that speed up recovery
- **Medicine Production**: Crafting higher grade bandages to improve quality

This comprehensive disease system creates ongoing challenges that may require manual intervention.

## Disease Catalog

**Comprehensive Threat Assessment**

RuneEra features a diverse array of diseases, each presenting unique challenges and requiring specific 
management strategies. Understanding each disease's characteristics is crucial for effective settlement 
health management.

### Non-Fatal Diseases

**Manageable but Persistent Threats**

These diseases create ongoing challenges but won't directly kill your humanoids if managed properly:

#### **Dream Worm**
- **Effect**: Decreases sleep gain efficiency
- **Impact**: Humanoids require longer rest periods to recover fully

#### **Divoc Virus**
- **Effect**: Reduces attack speed and damage multiplier
- **Critical Threshold**: Maintaining 100% disease progress induces permanent unconsciousness

#### **Mind Root**
- **Effect**: Decreases overall mood and mental well-being
- **Impact**: Affects social interactions and work motivation

#### **Muscle Tremor**
- **Effect**: Reduces work speed and endurance
- **Impact**: Significantly impacts physical labor efficiency

#### **Nova Pox**
- **Effect**: Decreases damage reduction and healing received multiplier
- **Impact**: Makes humanoids more vulnerable to combat and slower to recover

#### **Stomach Bacteria**
- **Effect**: Increases calorie consumption rate
- **Impact**: Requires additional food resources to maintain health

### Fatal Diseases

**Life-Threatening Conditions**

These diseases can result in permanent death if not properly treated and require immediate medical attention:

#### **Feral Fever**
- **Effect**: Periodical chance to enter feral frenzy, causing infected humanoids to attack and consume nearby animals
- **Danger**: Can disrupt livestock and create chaos in settlements

#### **Flu**
- **Effect**: Significantly decreases movement speed
- **Progression**: Can become fatal if left untreated

#### **Plague**
- **Effect**: Drastically decreases healing received from all sources
- **Danger**: Makes recovery from other injuries or diseases extremely difficult

#### **Rabies**
- **Effect**: Periodically causes uncontrollable aggression toward other humanoids
- **Transmission**: Can spread infection through combat hits

### Disease Management Strategies
- **Immediate Response**: Priority medical treatment and quarantine
- **Resource Allocation**: Dedicate best medical personnel and supplies
- **Containment**: Strict isolation protocols to prevent spread


### Critical Disease Interactions

**Compound Threat Assessment**

#### **Disease Stacking**
- Multiple diseases can affect the same humanoid simultaneously
- Combined effects can create devastating penalties
- Priority treatment protocols needed for multiple infections

#### **Social Impact**
- Aggressive diseases (Rabies, Feral Fever) can disrupt entire settlements
- Contagious diseases require community-wide response protocols
- Economic impact from reduced work efficiency and increased resource consumption

This comprehensive disease system ensures that health management remains a constant strategic consideration, 
where preparation, rapid response, and proper medical infrastructure determine the difference between a 
thriving settlement and a colony devastated by disease.
