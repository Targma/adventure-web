# Settlements

*Strategic expansion and resource management across multiple locations*

## Overview

Settlement expansion enables access to diverse biome resources and accelerates tier 
progression. While not mandatory, establishing outposts in different biomes provides significant 
strategic advantages through specialized resource access and mana generation.

## Settlement Progression

**Initial Setup**
- Begin with single settlement
- Unlock additional settlement capacity through technology research
- Each new settlement requires initial mana investment
- Establishment costs scale with area tier level

## Strategic Considerations

**Biome Diversification**
- Different biomes offer unique resources and opportunities
- Specialized settlements enable tier-specific material access
- Reduces dependency on trade for essential materials
- Provides strategic redundancy for critical resources

**Management Approaches**
- **Full settlements**: Complete infrastructure and population
- **Outposts**: Smaller, specialized resource extraction points
- **Portal networks**: Connect distant settlements for efficient resource and humanoid transport

## Settlement Benefits

**Resource Access**
- Biome-specific materials and opportunities
- Reduced transportation costs for specialized resources
- Access to unique environmental conditions

**Mana Generation**
- Pylon mana gathering capabilities
- Essence processing for progression requirements
- Strategic positioning for mana network optimization

## Event & Quest System

**Dynamic Content**
- Settlements attract events and quests
- Content distribution weighted by humanoid population
- Larger settlements receive more significant opportunities
- Multiple settlements do not increase overall content generation

## Management Challenges

**Complexity Scaling**
- Multiple settlements increase management overhead
- Resource distribution and logistics coordination
- Population allocation and specialization decisions
- Portal network planning and maintenance

::: tip Outpost Strategy
Consider establishing smaller outposts connected by portals rather than full settlements. 
This provides biome access while minimizing management complexity.

::: warning Mana Investment
Higher tier areas require substantial mana investment for settlement establishment.
Plan expansion timing carefully to avoid resource shortages.
