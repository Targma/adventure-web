# Arrest System

*Non-lethal restraint mechanics for community management*

## Overview

Arrest provides a tactical restraint option for managing disruptive community members without 
resorting to lethal force. Any humanoid can attempt to arrest another, creating temporary but 
complete action prevention.

## Arrest Mechanics

**Success Rate Factors**
- Target's missing vitality (injured targets easier to restrain)
- Tier difference between arrester and target (higher tier advantage)

**Effects**
- Complete action prevention for arrested individual
- Significant negative mood penalty applied
- Temporary but absolute behavioral control

## Strategic Considerations

**When to Use**
- Managing violent conflicts without casualties
- Restraining dangerous individuals temporarily
- Community discipline for serious violations

**Risks**
- Requires injuring target for reliable success
- Arrested humanoids will attempt escape when mood deteriorates
- May escalate tensions if used inappropriately

::: warning Use Sparingly
Arrest should be reserved for necessary situations only, as it requires violence to be effective and 
creates lasting negative mood effects.
