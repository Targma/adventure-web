# Husbandry

*Animal management for sustainable resource production and transportation*

## Overview

Husbandry provides efficient leather and meat acquisition through strategic animal management. 
Success requires careful planning of breeding programs, habitat management, and transportation logistics.

## Animal Varieties

**Wildlife Diversity**
- **50 different animals** 10 for each biome
- **Meat & Hide** There are 10 different meats and 10 different hides

## Getting Started

**Breeding Requirements**
- Tame animals of both sexes
- House breeding pairs in enclosed spaces or pens
- Maintain appropriate dietary needs for each species

## Animal Capture & Management

**Rope System**
- **Tamed animals**: Simple time-based roping operation
- **Wild animals**: Requires lasso for initial capture
- Roped animals become non-hostile and follow owner
- Essential for transporting animals between biomes

**Capture Strategy**
- Use caravans to transport captured animals home
- Target animals from different biomes for variety

## Transportation Benefits

**Caravan Enhancement**
- Tamed animals increase inventory weight capacity
- Significantly faster caravan travel speeds
- Essential for long-range exploration and trading

## Management Considerations

**Habitat Requirements**
- Species-specific dietary needs
- Predator-prey separation essential
- Temperature comfort zones
- Adequate space for breeding populations

**Resource Planning**
- Sustainable breeding cycles for leather/meat
- Transportation animal reserves
- Feed production and storage
- Seasonal care requirements

::: tip Breeding Strategy
Maintain breeding pairs of multiple species to ensure steady resource production and transportation capabilities.
:::

::: warning Predator Management
Never house predatory animals with prey species. This will result in lost livestock and disrupted breeding programs.
