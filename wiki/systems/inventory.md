# Inventory System

**Weight-Based Storage Management**

The inventory system in RuneEra operates on a weight-based capacity model that provides flexible
storage solutions while maintaining realistic carrying limitations. This system affects both individual 
humanoids and settlement infrastructure, creating strategic decisions about resource allocation and logistics.

## Inventory Mechanics

**Weight-Based Capacity System**

### Core Principles
- **Weight Limitation**: All inventories are constrained by maximum weight capacity rather than item slots
- **Unlimited Items**: Any number of items can be stored as long as total weight remains within limits
- **Flexible Storage**: Allows for diverse item combinations and strategic packing decisions
- **Universal Application**: System applies to both humanoids, animals and storage structures

### Capacity Determination
- **Base Capacity**: Each entity has a fundamental weight limit
- **Equipment**: Bags and storage equipment can increase humanoids carrying capacity
- **Animals**: Different animals may have varying base carrying capacities

### Management
- **Whitelist**: Structure and animals storages have whitelist, that specifies which items and what amount to accept.
- **Load Order**: Order humanoids to load storage with items specified in whitelist.


## Humanoid Inventory Management

**Personal Storage and Logistics**

### Essential Carrying Capacity
- **Survival Supplies**: Food, medical supplies for extended activities
- **Work Tools**: Specialized equipment required for assigned tasks
- **Combat Equipment**: Weapons, armor, repair tools and tactical supplies

### Strategic Inventory Planning
- **Task-Specific Loads**: Optimize carried items based on assigned activities
- **Emergency Supplies**: Maintain essential items for unexpected situations
- **Resource Collection**: Uses own gathering inventory that matches max weight of primary inventory
- **Trade Items**: Carry valuable goods for commerce and negotiation


## Storage Structures
- **Storage box**: Large-scale storage facilities for bulk resources
- **Small storage box**: Smaller-scale storage facilities for bulk resources
- **Cooler**: Limited to storing consumables, slows down consumable deterioration


This comprehensive inventory system creates meaningful logistical challenges and strategic decisions, 
where effective resource management becomes as important as resource acquisition in building a successful settlement.
