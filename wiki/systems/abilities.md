# Ability Runes

**Unlock Your Potential Through Ancient Power**

Ability runes are mystical artifacts that grant humanoids access to extraordinary powers and combat techniques. Each rune contains concentrated magical energy that, when properly attuned, bestows specific abilities upon the wielder.

## Rune Mastery System

To harness the power of an ability rune, characters must meet specific prerequisites:

- **Attribute Requirements**: Each rune demands minimum attribute thresholds that reflect the physical, mental, or spiritual demands of the ability
- **Tier Progression**: Higher-tier runes require corresponding character advancement, ensuring abilities scale appropriately with player progression
- **Attunement Process**: Runes can be unequipped, but doing so afflicts the character with rune exhaustion debilitating condition that prevents any further rune modifications for 7 days

This system ensures that powerful abilities remain meaningful rewards for character development while maintaining balanced progression throughout your journey.
