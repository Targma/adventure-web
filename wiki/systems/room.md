# Room

*Enclosed spaces that provide specialized functionality and environmental control*

## Build

To create a room, you must build a completely enclosed space using walls. Doors count as part of the wall and are required for access.

**Construction Requirements**
- Complete wall enclosure
- At least one door for access
- Standard walls only (natural rock and fortified walls cannot be used)

## Size Requirements

Rooms are categorized by their internal area:

- **Small room**: Minimal space for basic functionality (1-14)
- **Basic room**: Standard size for most purposes (15-128)
- **Large room**: Expanded capacity for multiple functions (129-225)

## Environmental Systems

### Temperature

A room's ability to maintain temperature depends on:
- **Room size**: Larger rooms require more energy to heat or cool
- **Wall insulation**: Better insulation reduces energy demand
- **Temperature sources**: Heaters, coolers, and other climate control

*Insulation values are displayed in hover tooltips in parentheses next to temperature.*

### Luxury

Room comfort is determined by:
- **Flooring quality**: Material and craftsmanship
- **Furniture placement**: Type and arrangement of items
- **Overall aesthetics**: Combined visual appeal

*Luxury values are displayed in hover tooltips in the room section.*
