# Portal Network

*Advanced magical infrastructure enabling fast travel and resource transportation across vast distances*

## Overview

Portals represent the pinnacle of magical engineering, providing instant transportation between distant locations. 
These complex structures require significant investment in construction, activation, and maintenance, but offer unparalleled strategic mobility.

## Portal Construction

### Construction Requirements
- **Materials**: High-tier resources (planks, metal bars, stone blocks)
- **Footprint**: 3x3 tile area
- **Build Time**: Substantial construction duration
- **Location**: One portal per world area maximum

## Portal Activation

### Attunement Phase
**Initial Setup**
- **Cost**: 80 mana (scaled by world settings)
- **Duration**: 14 hours attunement process
- **Effect**: Creates portal marker on world map
- **Limitation**: Only one portal per area can be attuned

**Defensive Challenge**
- Attunement attracts undead swarm
- Portal must be protected during vulnerable phase
- Failed defense results in portal destruction

### Usage Generation
**Charge System**
- Attuned portals automatically generate usage charges
- **Cooldown**: 4 days between charge generation
- **Capacity**: Maximum uses varies by portal tier
- **Efficiency**: Higher tiers generate more charges

## Portal Operations

### Travel Connections
**Personal Travel**
- **Cost**: 30 mana per journey
- **Preparation**: 1 hour opening duration
- **Active Window**: 3 hours once opened
- **Capacity**: Transports units and roped animals together

**Connection Requirements**
- Can only link to other attuned portals

### Item Transportation
**Transfer Mode**
- **Cost**: 15 mana per transfer
- **Function**: Swaps entire storage contents between portals
- **Duration**: Same opening requirements as travel
- **Efficiency**: Ideal for bulk resource management

## Strategic Applications

### Network Planning
**Location Selection**
- Strategic positioning for maximum coverage
- Consider resource access points
- Plan defensive positions around portals
- Account for future expansion needs

**Resource Management**
- Long-distance supply chains
- Emergency resource deployment
- Specialized material distribution
- Settlement interconnection

### Operational Considerations
**Mana Economics**
- High operational costs require careful budgeting
- Multiple portals create expensive but powerful network
- Balance expansion with maintenance capabilities

**Usage Optimization**
- Limited daily uses demand strategic planning
- Coordinate travel and transport operations
- Maintain mana reserves for emergency access

### Maintenance Requirements
- Regular mana investment for continued operation
- Protection from hostile forces
- Structural integrity monitoring
- Network coordination management

::: tip Network Efficiency
Plan portal placement for maximum strategic value. Consider resource nodes, 
defensive positions, and future expansion when selecting locations.
:::

::: warning Attunement Vulnerability
The 14-hour attunement process attracts dangerous undead swarms. Ensure 
strong defenses are in place before beginning portal activation.
:::

::: info Usage Limits
Portal charges regenerate slowly (4-day cooldown). Plan long-distance
operations carefully to avoid being stranded without transportation.
