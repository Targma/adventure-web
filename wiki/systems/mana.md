# Mana

*Core magical resource essential for progression and advanced gameplay mechanics*

## Overview

Mana serves as the primary magical energy source, powering abilities, structures, and advanced technologies. 
Your maximum mana capacity increases through technology research, while generation depends on strategic infrastructure placement.

## Mana Generation

### Base Generation
- Small passive mana generation
- Provides minimal but consistent mana income

### Pylon Network
Strategic mana generation through pylon placement:

**Efficiency Factors**
- **Pylon tier**: Higher tier pylons generate more mana
- **Pylon rarity**: Higher rarity pylons generate more mana
- **Pylon density**: Multiple pylons in same area reduce individual efficiency

**Optimization Strategy**
- Spread pylons across different areas for maximum efficiency
- Upgrade pylon tiers for better generation rates
- Balance expansion with maintenance costs

## Mana Consumption

### Magical Structures
- **Heatrock**: Temperature control for heating
- **Frostrock**: Temperature control for cooling
- **Portal networks**: Fast travel between locations

## Mana Depletion & Environmental Impact

### Depletion Mechanics
- High mana generation strains the environment
- Increased generation triggers more frequent mana events
- Events become more extreme with higher depletion levels

### Management Strategy
- Balance generation with environmental stability
- Reduce generation temporarily to lower depletion
- Plan for increased event frequency during expansion

::: tip Ability Management
Mana abilities have lengthy cooldowns measured in days. Plan ability usage strategically for maximum impact rather than frequent casting.
:::

::: warning Depletion Consequences
High mana generation attracts dangerous events. Consider reducing generation temporarily if facing overwhelming magical disturbances.
