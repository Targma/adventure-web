# Health and Vitality System

**Advanced Combat Survivability Mechanics**

RuneEra employs a sophisticated dual-resource health system that addresses common issues found in traditional single-health RPG systems. 
This innovative approach creates meaningful consequences for sustained combat while preventing exploitation of unlimited healing strategies.

## Dual Health Resources

**Health and Vitality Working Together**

Unlike traditional RPGs that rely solely on health points, RuneEra introduces vitality as a secondary resource that fundamentally changes combat dynamics and long-term survivability.

### Health (Primary Resource)

**Immediate Damage Absorption**
- **Primary Target**: Absorbs the majority of incoming damage
- **Restoration**: Can be quickly restored through multiple sources including healing spells, potions, and medical treatment
- **Tactical Role**: Represents immediate survivability in combat encounters

### Vitality (Secondary Resource)

**Long-Term Survivability**
- **Damage Sharing**: Receives a small portion of all damage dealt to health
- **Overflow Protection**: When health reaches zero, all remaining damage transfers proportionally to vitality
- **Endurance Mitigation**: Damage to vitality can be reduced through the endurance stat
- **Limited Restoration**: Much more difficult to restore than health, creating strategic resource management

## Vitality Restoration Methods

**Careful Resource Management Required**

Vitality restoration is intentionally limited to prevent exploitation and maintain tactical depth:

### Natural Recovery Methods

**Rest and Treatment**
- **Slow Restoration**: Gradual vitality recovery through rest periods
- **Medical Treatment**: Enhanced recovery through proper medical care and facilities
- **Time Investment**: Requires significant time commitment for meaningful recovery

### Instant Recovery Options

**Vitality Potions**
- **Immediate Effect**: Instant vitality restoration when consumed
- **Cooldown Limitation**: Long cooldown periods prevent spam usage
- **Rare Resource**: Expensive and difficult to obtain, making each use strategic

## Critical Vitality Thresholds

**Escalating Consequences**

As vitality decreases, humanoids face increasingly severe penalties that can threaten their survival:

### Healing Efficiency Degradation

**Reduced Healing Effectiveness**
- **Progressive Penalty**: Healing received decreases proportionally as vitality drops
- **Compound Effect**: Lower vitality makes it harder to recover both health and vitality
- **Strategic Impact**: Creates a downward spiral that requires proactive vitality management
- **Tactical Consideration**: Wounded characters become increasingly difficult to sustain in combat


### 60% Vitality Threshold

**Bleeding Condition**
- **Trigger**: Activated when vitality falls below 60%
- **Effect**: Continuous vitality loss over time
- **Treatment Required**: Must be actively treated to prevent further deterioration
- **Strategic Impact**: Creates urgency for medical intervention

### 25% Vitality Threshold

**Unconsciousness**
- **Trigger**: Activated when vitality falls below 25%
- **Effect**: Humanoid becomes permanently unconscious and incapable of any actions
- **Dependency**: Requires treatment from other humanoids to recover
- **Tactical Consequence**: Removes the character from combat and work assignments

### 0% Vitality Threshold

**Death**
- **Trigger**: When vitality reaches zero
- **Effect**: Permanent character death
- **Consequence**: Complete loss of the humanoid, including all equipment, skills, and progression
- **Strategic Impact**: Makes vitality management crucial for long-term guild survival

## Strategic Combat Implications

**Preventing Healing Exploitation**

The vitality system addresses several common RPG balance issues:

### Limited Healing Effectiveness

**Tank and Healer Limitations**
- **Problem Solved**: Prevents prolonged boss fights where one tank with unlimited healing can trivialize encounters
- **Strategic Depth**: Forces players to consider damage mitigation and tactical positioning
- **Resource Management**: Makes healing a finite resource rather than unlimited solution

### Sustained Combat Consequences

**Attrition Warfare**
- **Cumulative Damage**: Even successful combats leave lasting effects through vitality damage
- **Recovery Time**: Requires downtime between major encounters for full recovery
- **Strategic Planning**: Encourages careful engagement timing and preparation

## Endurance Stat Integration

**Defensive Specialization**

The endurance stat provides meaningful protection against vitality damage:

- **Damage Reduction**: Reduces the portion of damage that affects vitality
- **Survivability**: Allows tanks and frontline fighters to sustain more punishment
- **Character Building**: Creates value for defensive attribute investment

## Tactical Considerations

**Managing Both Resources**

Effective combat requires balancing both health and vitality management:

### Short-Term Tactics
- **Health Priority**: Focus on maintaining health for immediate survival
- **Healing Timing**: Use healing abilities strategically to maximize effectiveness
- **Damage Mitigation**: Employ defensive abilities to minimize incoming damage

### Long-Term Strategy
- **Vitality Conservation**: Avoid unnecessary risks that could damage vitality
- **Recovery Planning**: Schedule downtime for vitality restoration
- **Medical Infrastructure**: Invest in medical facilities and trained healers

This dual-resource system creates meaningful consequences for combat decisions while preventing the
trivialization of challenging encounters through unlimited healing, resulting in more engaging and 
strategic gameplay.
