# Combat System

*Real-time tactical warfare with strategic depth*

## Overview

RuneEra employs a sophisticated real-time combat system that seamlessly blends continuous 
action with strategic planning. Combat flows naturally in real-time, 
but player retain absolute control through comprehensive pause mechanics, 
allowing for tactical analysis and precise order coordination at any moment.

## Core Combat Mechanics

### Time Control & Command

**Real-Time Flow**
: Combat progresses continuously, creating dynamic and fluid battlefield 
conditions where timing and positioning matter as much as raw power.

**Strategic Pause**
: Player can halt time instantly to reassess battlefield conditions, 
issue new orders, and adjust tactical approaches without pressure.

**Variable Time Scale**
: Control the pace of engagement to match your preferred command style, 
from methodical tactical planning to intense real-time action.

### Victory Determinants

Combat outcomes are influenced by multiple interconnected factors:

**Unit Composition & Numbers**
: The foundation of tactical superiority lies in deploying the right 
combination of specialists in optimal quantities for each engagement type.

**Equipment Mastery**
: Gear quality, weapon proficiency, and armor effectiveness create 
significant power differentials that can overcome numerical disadvantages.

**Ability Utilization**
: Strategic deployment of runic abilities, special techniques, and 
timing-sensitive maneuvers often determines the outcome of closely matched encounters.

**Consumable Resources**
: Potions, elixirs, and tactical items provide crucial battlefield 
advantages that can shift momentum at critical moments.

## Advanced Tactical Systems

### Mana Command Authority

**Global Mana Abilities**
: Player wields powerful mana abilities that can directly 
alter battlefield conditions, from environmental manipulation to direct damage dealing.

**Strategic Resource Management**
: Mana represents a finite but renewable resource that must be carefully 
allocated across multiple tactical options during prolonged engagements.

### Target Prioritization

Effective combat requires understanding enemy vulnerabilities 
and adapting targeting strategies accordingly:

**Spellcaster Vulnerability**
: Casting units suffer maximum disruption from attack progress 
knockback, making them priority targets for interrupt-focused strategies.

**Ranged Unit Disruption**
: Archers and similar ranged combatants experience moderate 
knockback effects, allowing for effective harassment tactics.

**Melee Resistance**
: Close-combat specialists remain immune to attack progress 
knockback, requiring alternative tactical approaches such as crowd control or overwhelming force.

### Environmental Warfare

**Terrain Utilization**
: Natural and constructed chokepoints become force 
multipliers when facing numerically superior opponents.

**Mana-Enhanced Terrain**
: Environmental abilities can create temporary barriers, difficult 
terrain, or tactical advantages that reshape the battlefield to favor strategic positioning.

**Crowd Control Mastery**
: Effective use of immobilization, slowing effects, and area 
denial ensures that superior numbers cannot be brought to bear simultaneously.

## Tactical Principles

### Engagement Doctrine

**Threat Assessment**
: Identify and neutralize the most dangerous opponents first, 
typically spellcasters and specialized damage dealers.

**Crowd Control Priority**
: Disable key threats through strategic application of stuns, 
immobilization, and other status effects rather than attempting to eliminate all enemies simultaneously.

**Resource Conservation**
: Balance immediate tactical needs with long-term sustainability, 
ensuring that consumables and mana are available for critical moments.

**Positioning Superiority**
: Leverage terrain, chokepoints, and formation advantages 
to negate enemy numerical superiority.

### Combat Flow Management

**Initiative Control**
: Maintain battlefield tempo through aggressive positioning, 
threat elimination, and resource denial.

**Adaptive Strategy**
: Continuously reassess and adjust tactical approaches 
based on emerging battlefield conditions and enemy responses.

**Escalation Management**
: Gradually deploy more powerful abilities and resources as engagement 
intensity increases, reserving ultimate techniques for decisive moments.
