# Farming & Gathering

*Sustainable resource production through agriculture and herbalism*

## Overview

Farming and gathering represent two distinct professions essential for long-term sustainability. 
Farming focuses on food crop production, while gathering specializes in herbs for alchemy and medicine.

## Plant Varieties

**Agricultural Diversity**
- **18 different crops** for food production and cooking
- **15 herbs** for alchemy, medicine, and specialized crafting
- **10 tree types** for lumber, special structures, and equipment


## Getting Started

**Seed Acquisition**
- Craft seeds from existing harvested resources
- Harvest wild crops/herbs in the environment
- Trade with nearby factions for initial stock
- Establish sustainable seed production cycles

## Environmental Requirements

**Critical Factors**
- **Season**: Plant timing affects growth cycles
- **Temperature**: Plants die outside permitted ranges
- **Biome compatibility**: Wrong biome creates permanent growth penalties

**Optimization Techniques**
- Plow tiles and create field floors for faster growth
- Water crops regularly for optimal development
- Apply fertilizer (crafted from wood and water in compost)

## Advanced Techniques

**Greenhouse Technology** *(Higher Tiers)*
- Protected environment from weather and events
- Reduced sunlight decreases growth speed
- Requires maintained temperature control
- Eliminates external environmental risks

## Challenges & Solutions

**Environmental Threats**
- Adverse weather conditions
- Biome-specific events
- Temperature fluctuations
- Seasonal limitations

**Management Strategies**
- Plan crop rotations around seasons
- Maintain emergency food reserves
- Invest in greenhouse infrastructure
- Diversify crop types for resilience

::: tip Biome Selection
Always plant in appropriate biomes. The permanent growth penalty from wrong biome placement 
severely impacts long-term productivity.

::: warning Temperature Management
Monitor temperature ranges carefully. Plant death from temperature extremes can devastate 
food supplies and herb production.
