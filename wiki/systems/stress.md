# Stress System

**Psychological Pressure and Breaking Points**

The stress system in RuneEra represents the psychological toll of survival in a harsh,
dangerous world. Unlike physical health systems, stress measures mental resilience and the 
inevitable breaking points that occur when humanoids are pushed beyond their limits.

## Stress Mechanics

**Psychological Pressure Accumulation**

### Stress Progression
- **Mood Dependency**: Stress accumulation rate is directly influenced by current mood levels
- **High Mood**: Faster stress reduction
- **Low Mood**: Accelerated stress buildup

### Critical Threshold
- **100% Stress**: Triggers potential stress-induced breakdown
- **Chance-Based Resolution**: 50% probability to naturally reduce stress by 30%
- **Breakdown Trigger**: Failed stress resolution results in involuntary stress reaction
- **Unpredictable Timing**: Stress reactions can occur at any moment once threshold is reached

## Stress Intervention Methods

**Managing Psychological Crises**

### Emergency Interventions
- **Unconsciousness**: Rendering the humanoid unconscious interrupts stress reactions
- **Arrest**: Forcibly restraining the individual can halt destructive behaviors
- **Risk Factor**: Both interventions may worsen the situation
- **Temporary Solution**: Addresses immediate crisis but doesn't resolve root causes
- **Mana Ability**: Specific mana rune ability can directly remove stress


## Stress-Induced Reactions

**Breakdown Manifestations**

When stress overwhelms a humanoid's, the resulting breakdown 
manifests as uncontrollable, destructive behaviors that can devastate settlement operations.

### Passive Disruption Reactions

**Withdrawal and Avoidance Behaviors**

#### **Aimlessly Wandering**
- **Behavior**: Humanoid wanders around the settlement without purpose
- **Impact**: Lost productivity and potential exposure to environmental dangers

#### **Hide In Room**
- **Behavior**: Seeks isolation in private spaces for extended periods
- **Impact**: Complete work stoppage and potential social isolation

### Social Disruption Reactions

**Interpersonal Conflict Behaviors**

#### **Fighting**
- **Behavior**: Initiates unprovoked combat with random settlement members
- **Risk**: Physical injury to multiple individuals
- **Impact**: Damages social cohesion and may trigger chain reactions

#### **Insults**
- **Behavior**: Verbally attacks other humanoids with harsh criticism
- **Effect**: Decreases mood of targeted individuals
- **Impact**: Spreads negative psychological effects throughout settlement

#### **Disruptor**
- **Behavior**: Actively interferes with other humanoids' work and crafting activities
- **Effect**: Reduces settlement-wide productivity
- **Impact**: Can halt critical production during vital periods

### Destructive Consumption Reactions

**Resource Depletion Behaviors**

#### **Eating**
- **Behavior**: Consumes excessive amounts of food in short periods
- **Impact**: Depletes food stores
- **Risk**: Can trigger food shortages during critical periods

#### **Bloodlust**
- **Behavior**: Attacks and kills multiple animals in the vicinity
- **Impact**: Destroys valuable livestock and hunting resources
- **Risk**: Eliminates essential food and material sources

### Property Destruction Reactions

**Infrastructure Damage Behaviors**

#### **Destroyer**
- **Behavior**: Seeks out and destroys valuable items and equipment
- **Target**: Prioritizes high-value portable goods
- **Impact**: Significant economic losses and resource depletion

#### **Destruction**
- **Behavior**: Attacks and destroys valuable furniture and structures
- **Target**: Focuses on important settlement infrastructure
- **Impact**: Compromises living conditions and operational capacity

#### **Pyromaniac**
- **Behavior**: Deliberately sets settlement structures on fire
- **Risk**: Catastrophic fire spread and complete settlement destruction
- **Impact**: Potentially burn down entire settlement

#### **Mess Maker**
- **Behavior**: Gathers items and scatters them randomly throughout settlement
- **Effect**: Disrupts organization and creates cleanup burdens
- **Impact**: Reduces efficiency and creates additional work

## Strategic Stress Management

- **Early Warning**: Monitor stress levels and identify at-risk individuals
- **Resource Protection**: Secure valuable items and critical infrastructure
- **Provide mood boost**: Use items that boost mood


This comprehensive stress system ensures that psychological well-being remains a 
critical consideration in settlement management, where maintaining mental health is as 
important as physical survival in the harsh world of RuneEra.
