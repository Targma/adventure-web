**Technical Foundation**

RuneEra is built on the [Godot Engine](https://godotengine.org/) using C# for robust performance and maintainability. 
The game architecture follows [Entity Component System (ECS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_component_system) design principles, enhanced with reactive programming 
patterns to ensure efficient data flow and system interactions.

**Performance & Scalability**

The game leverages multi-threading at the entity level through C#'s Task system, enabling concurrent processing of individual units, 
environmental elements, wildlife, and global systems. When entities interact, sophisticated locking mechanisms ensure thread safety while maintaining optimal performance. 
All core simulation logic runs within the C# environment, with Godot Engine handling visualization and rendering.

**Future Development**

While the current technical foundation is solid, we recognize opportunities for further optimization and enhancement. 
Resource allocation will be guided by community feedback and project milestones as we continue development.
