# Modding Support

## Current Status

**üõ†Ô∏è High Priority Feature**: Modding support is a top priority for RuneEra development,
but is currently postponed due to the alpha nature of the build.

## Why Not Available Yet?

### Technical Considerations
- **Frequent Code Changes**: The alpha codebase undergoes rapid iteration and structural changes
- **API Stability**: Core game systems need to stabilize before exposing modding interfaces
- **Documentation Requirements**: Comprehensive modding documentation requires a stable foundation

### Timeline
Modding support implementation will begin once the codebase reaches sufficient stability, 
likely during the pre-release polish phase (Phase 3 of our roadmap).

## Designed for Modding

### Architecture Benefits
RuneEra was built from the ground up with modding in mind:

- **Modular Design**: Game systems are structured for easy extension and modification
- **Plugin-Ready Architecture**: Core systems designed to support external additions

## Planned Modding Features

### Content Creation
- **Custom Items & Equipment**: Create new weapons, armor, and magical items
- **New Buildings & Structures**: Design unique settlement buildings and decorations
- **Additional Quests**: Craft custom storylines and quest chains
- **Biome Expansion**: Add new environments and exploration areas

### Gameplay Modifications
- **Balance Adjustments**: Tweak game mechanics and difficulty settings
- **New Magic Systems**: Expand rune magic with custom spells and abilities
- **Economic Systems**: Modify trading, resources, and settlement economics
- **Event Creation**: Design custom dynamic events and challenges

## Community Involvement

### Feedback Welcome
We're actively seeking community input on modding priorities:
- **Feature Requests**: What modding capabilities are most important to you?
- **Use Cases**: Share your modding ideas and planned projects
- **Technical Preferences**: Preferred scripting languages or modding tools

### Future Documentation
When modding support launches, we'll provide:
- **Comprehensive API Documentation**: Detailed guides for all modding interfaces
- **Tutorial Series**: Step-by-step modding tutorials for beginners
- **Community Resources**: Forums, Discord channels, and example mods
- **Developer Tools**: Specialized tools for mod creation and testing
