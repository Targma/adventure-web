**Tier-Based Progression System**

RuneEra features a comprehensive five-tier progression system, designated by Roman numerals I through V.
This structured advancement framework ensures meaningful growth and introduces increasingly complex challenges as players develop their settlements and guild members.

**Tier Advancement**

Each tier unlock grants access to:
- **Advanced Equipment**: Higher-quality weapons, armor, and tools
- **Enhanced Potions**: More potent healing and buff consumables
- **New Structures**: Upgraded buildings and specialized facilities
- **Expanded Abilities**: Additional skills and magical capabilities
- **Research Opportunities**: Access to new technologies

**Progression Requirements**

To advance from one tier to the next, players must demonstrate mastery across multiple areas:

1. **Biome**: Successfully establish and maintain operations in your current tier's environment
2. **Boss**: Defeat dungeon boss that drops essence core
3. **Research**: Invest time and resources into unlocking the next tier's technology

**Escalating Challenges**

Higher tiers introduce greater challenges and rewards:

- **Areas**: Higher tier areas need to be explored, with harsher environments
- **Stronger Adversaries**: Face more formidable creatures and factions
- **Environmental Intensity**: Increased severity of weather events, diseases, and random encounters
- **Epic Events**: With each tier, new epic world events can occur

**Risk and Reward Balance**

The tier system creates a natural risk-reward progression where venturing into higher-tier zones yields superior resources and equipment, but at the cost of significantly increased danger. 
By pausing exploration of higher-tier zones, intensity will slowly degrade.
This encourages players to carefully balance their expansion ambitions with their current capabilities, creating meaningful strategic decisions at every stage of development.
